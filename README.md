# Motion Canvas Editor Demo Project

This project demonstrates basic usage of the [motion-canvas-editor](https://github.com/sysraccoon/motion-canvas-editor) library
with session file generated by [motion-canvas-editor.nvim](https://github.com/sysraccoon/motion-canvas-editor.nvim)

The result is an animation demonstrating the code of this project ;)
